# Huffman Encoder(hmencoder)

Introduction
The hmencoder program implements the Huffman encoding algorithm. It takes a text file as input, calculates the frequency of each character, builds a Huffman tree, generates Huffman codes for the characters, and encodes the message. It outputs the generated codes and the encoded message into separate files.
